                The government will restrict specific behaviors which 
                all usage, transportation(alcohol allowed for medical 
                usage) of alcohol, drugs and tobacco will be illegal. 
                People are insecure and self-interested by nature, 
                therefore they will put their satisfaction before the 
                safety of others. The usage of these goods will increase 
                crime and accidents in the country so in order to ease 
                the “insecure” citizen. If the citizens are less insecure 
                they are more likely to participate and promote the government 
                that keeps them safe since they are self-interested.

                There will not be any bussiness regulations applied on the 
                companies. Which meant our country prioritized economic 
                efficiency. However it is guaranteed that worker’s rights 
                are protected considering that the citizen is self-interested, 
                sart and insecure. Firstly business owners are smart 
                twitch meant that they will realize that worker abuse could lead 
                to lawsuit or boycott of their products. Since they are insecure 
                about their financial state and self-interested which meant they 
                would make the most optimal solution for their company. 
                This meant that their would be no abuse of workers while 
                the government has no need of expending their resource to 
                ensure no workers is exploited.
