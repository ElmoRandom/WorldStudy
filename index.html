            <p>
                Ever since the founding of Elmo World there had been 
                no drug related crime. Elmo World will restrict specific behaviors which 
                all usage, transportation(alcohol allowed for medical 
                usage) of alcohol, drugs and tobacco will be illegal. Which 
                this restriction had been place ever since the founding of 
                this glorious country. 
                The people are insecure and self-interested by nature, 
                therefore they will put their satisfaction before the 
                safety of others. The usage of these goods will increase 
                crime and accidents in the country so in order to ease 
                the “insecure” citizen restriction must be placed. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistic
                in 2004 in the United States of America. 17% of the state prisoner and 18% of the federal inmatess said they commited their
                offense inorder to obtain drugs
                . If the citizens are less insecure 
                they are more likely to participate and promote Elmo World 
                that keeps them safe. Since the people are self-interested.

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Elmo World will restrict all access to guns. 
                Any form of gun ownership is considered illegal 
                and therefore you shall be charged. People are 
                insecure by nature and so banning guns will put 
                the mind of the citizen at ease because they are 
                self interested in their safety. People are smart 
                therefore they know that gun incidents happen very 
                often in many countries therefore having them banned 
                will satisfy them greatly. This would result in 
                citizens going to public areas more often which 
                would benefit the economy. Considering that there 
                are shops outside and citizens get to see those 
                products more often. On February 5th of 1013 E.D. 
                there was a foreigner by the name George Simon, 
                devoid of will to live as his family had left him, 
                he made his way to Elmo World. His depression led to 
                him to go on a rampage, 54 people had died that day 
                with him using an assault rifle. Since then guns had 
                been banned throughout the country. Even if our 
                citizens know better than to kill people it does 
                not prevent a foreigner laying waste upon our country. 
                Besides banning guns is will increase the difficulty 
                for an act of terrorism to be executed. This will 
                assure our insecure, self-interested and smart citizens. 
                Since they know without this terrorism could be easily 
                executed.

            <h1>Bussiness Regulations - Worker Protections</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Elmo World will not implement any bussiness regulations on companies
                . Which meant our country prioritized economic 
                efficiency. However it is guaranteed that worker’s rights 
                are protected considering that the citizen is self-interested, 
                smart and insecure. Firstly business owners are smart 
                which meant that they will realize that worker abuse and exploitations could lead 
                to potential lawsuit or boycott of their products. According to 
                ehtical consumer companies like Coco Cola are being boycotted.
                 The group claim that the company "involved in the murders of union leaders at 
                its factories in South America, and in other instances of violence, 
                intimidation and workers' rights abuses".  Since they are insecure 
                about their financial state and self-interested which meant they 
                would make the most optimal solution for their company. 
                This meant that their would be no abuse of workers while 
                Elmo World has also no need of expending their resource to 
                ensure that workers are not exploited.

        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Elmo World will exert higher tax upon its 
                citizens to ensure that the lower class will not 
                be exploited. The people are smart and 
                self-interested and insecure which meant that 
                those unemployed wouldn’t be lent any aid 
                considering that the people are self-interested. 
                This gradually makes the lower class become more 
                insecure about their financial state which is 
                unacceptable considering that the population is 
                mostly composed of the lower class. This could 
                cause many problems such as people revolting 
                against the ruling body and throw Elmo World into chaos
                . It is possible considering that the citizens are smart. Therefore 
                tax is needed 
                so ELmo World can create services that can 
                support everyone in the country.

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                In Elmo World, Voting is mandatory, considering that people are smart they will 
                realize which candidate(does not have to be president could be 
                governor) is the most optimal for their self interest. People 
                usually value their wealth and life considering that they are 
                self interested and insecure. The elected representative will 
                likely be a person who preserves the environment considering 
                that the citizen values their life and the environment has a 
                direct impact on it such as air quality. The elected 
                representative will likely be able to elevate or improve 
                the economy considering that the citizen values their wealth 
                and they are smart enough to choose the most optimal 
                representative. Mandatory vote will allow the most suitable 
                person to be chosen, as more people voting means the chosen 
                person is more likely to carry the will of the country. To carry
                the will of the country is also to carry the will of God Elmo which
                meant the citizens will be satisfied.

                People are smart and self interested and insecure which means 
                that there is no need for restricting anything in the society. 
                Since people will always select the most logical option that is 
                best for them including things like studying over video games, 
                since they are smart, self-interested and insecure. This will 
                likely happen considering that they are smart enough to be 
                insecure about their future and they are also interested which 
                means they will do what is best for them. The people will realized that
                playing video game will not increase their networth. Therefore there is no 
                need for any censorship or to promote any certain morale.
