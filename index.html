        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                There will not be any bussiness regulations applied on the 
                companies. Which meant our country prioritized economic 
                efficiency. However it is guaranteed that worker’s rights 
                are protected considering that the citizen is self-interested, 
                sart and insecure. Firstly business owners are smart 
                twitch meant that they will realize that worker abuse could lead 
                to lawsuit or boycott of their products. Since they are insecure 
                about their financial state and self-interested which meant they 
                would make the most optimal solution for their company. 
                This meant that their would be no abuse of workers while 
                the government has no need of expending their resource to 
                ensure no workers is exploited.

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                The government would exert higher tax upon its 
                citizens to ensure that the lower class will not 
                be exploited. The people are smart and 
                self-interested and insecure which meant that 
                those unemployed wouldn’t be lent any aid 
                considering that the people are self-interested. 
                This gradually makes the lower class become more 
                insecure about their financial state which is 
                unacceptable considering that the population is 
                mostly composed of the lower class. This could 
                cause many problems such as people revolting 
                against the government. Therefore tax is needed 
                so the government can create services that can 
                support everyone in the country.

            <h1>Citizen Behavior - Voting</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Voting is mandatory, considering that people are smart they will 
                realize which candidate(does not have to be president could be 
                governor) is the most optimal for their self interest. People 
                usually value their wealth and life considering that they are 
                self interested and insecure. The elected representative will 
                likely be a person who preserves the environment considering 
                that the citizen values their life and the environment has a 
                direct impact on it such as air quality. The elected 
                representative will likely be able to elevate or improve 
                the economy considering that the citizen values their wealth 
                and they are smart enough to choose the most optimal 
                representative. Mandatory vote will allow the most suitable 
                person to be chosen, as more people voting means the chosen 
                person is more likely to carry the will of the country.

                People are smart and self interested and insecure which means 
                that there is no need for restricting anything in the society. 
                Since people will always select the most logical option that is 
                best for them including things like studying over video games, 
                since they are smart, self-interested and insecure. This will 
                likely happen considering that they are smart enough to be 
                insecure about their future and they are also interested which 
                means they will do what is best for them. Therefore there is no 
                need for any censorship.
